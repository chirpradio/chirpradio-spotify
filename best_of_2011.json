      "description": "As inventive as any album this year, Merrill Gerbus’ sound is a junkyard of Afro-Caribbean, R&B, Funk, and Modern Rock influences, though her voice maybe her music’s most unique quality. After her first album, BiRd-BrAiNs, found an audience despite being recorded on a digital voice recorder, Gerbus’ took advantage of her first studio-recorded release that turns tunes to treasure. —James Vest"

      "description": "This album is beautiful in its quiet grace, and the honesty of its lyrics. Even 9 months after its release these songs still get happily stuck in my head. —Liz Smyth"

      "release": "Kaputt",
      "description": "I haven’t listened to any other album this year more than Kaputt. I am infatuated with every track here. I guess artistic audacity just gets me every time. I want to hear someone giving a crazy idea his all, even if that could potentially mean utter failure. Dan Bejar could’ve made the worst decision of his life by releasing Kaputt, but as long as listeners like me are around, we’ll make sure this isn’t the last time an artist doesn’t play it safe. Kaputt is my favorite album of the year. —Dylan Peterson"

      "label": "Captured Tracks",
      "release": "Nocturne",
      "description": "Further solidifying his place in the Dream-Pop scene, the 2nd album from Wild Nothing (aka Jack Tatum) features more of the refined, polished, relentlessly gentle sound (a combination of jangle-pop guitars and synth-based bass and drums) he first emerged with in 2010. This is one of the all-around best sonically crafted albums I've heard this year. --Clarence Ewing"

      "release": "channel ORANGE",
      "description": "About one month ago, I was out and about in Milwaukee celebrating a friend's birthday, and when we ended up back at the home of our hostess she put on Frank Ocean. Everyone, and I mean everyone, even the people I'd seen only peripherally since graduating high school, immediately launched into drunken singalong to 'Thinking About You,' even the falsetto chorus. There were champagne and feelings all over the place. It was nice. --Maddie Hannes"

      "release": "Swing Lo Magellan",
      "description": "I loved 'Bita Orca,'' but I wasn't sure what to expect after hearing the first single from Swing Lo Magellan, 'Gun Has No Trigger.' The complex instrumentation and vocal interplay are still there, but this album is a step in a whole new direction. The instruments are sparse, the vocals are dense and the lyrical imagery is dark. One of the best records in years. --Curtis Swank"

      "artist": "Azaelia Banks",
      "label": "Interscope",
      "release": "1991",
      "description": "This is the kind of record that makes me fairly certain I've wasted my life. It's called 1991 because that's the year the artist was born. *sigh* Kids these days. Despite her young age, Ms. Banks is an accomplished musician, having trained at the LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts in her native NYC. No wonder her 4-song EP was enough to get her a #3 spot on my list this year. Each track is a booty-shakin' fun bomb with infinitely more chops than the over-produced dreck you'll hear on most dance-centric radio stations these days. That said, she has drawn many comparisons with Nicki Minaj, which I can see, but don't agree with. Where Minaj is all spectacle and vinyl dresses, Banks is all business. Her first solo record drops this coming February and I can't wait to pick it up. Released on Polydor/Interscope, you know it's going to be some quality stuff. Oh, and Nicki? Watch your back, girl. There's a new sheriff in town. --Nicole Oppenheim"

      "release": "Home Again",
      "description": "In an age where everyone sounds like a tribute band, a 24 year-old Anglo-Ugandan with the voice of Bill Withers, playing sophisticated soulful jazz and folk is a long, cool drink of The Real Thing. This amazing debut album from a man who’s talent may propel him to become an Amy-Winehouse-sized sensation. --James Vest"

      "label": "Slumberland Records",
      "release": "Wild Peace",
      "description": "Echo Lake’s Wild Peace is pure captivating dreamscape. This was an easy number one slot filler since it’s an album I came to again and again and not just for the catchy singles. Listening to this album can easily be equated to sitting in a reclining chair while soaking in the sunshine. --Katie Owens"

      "artist": "The White Wires",
      "label": "Dirtnap",
      "release": "World War III",
      "description": "The White Wires are a Canadian garage rock band from Ontario, Canada. This album and The White Wires for the most part, blends old school Ramones-era punk rock with pop, but calling them a pop-punk band is a misnomer. All 14 tracks are evenly balanced, and incredibly re-playable, with fun/energetic bass lines and smooth lyrics of nostalgia and girls. --Nathan Hennon"

      "artist": "Neneh Cherry & the Thing",
      "label": "Smalltown Supersound",
      "release": "The Cherry Thing",
      "description": "Free jazz isn’t normally my thing (ahem), but this collaboration between the ever-exploring Neneh Cherry and the Swedish trio that named itself after one of her stepdad’s compositions completely won me over. The set is made up mainly of a fascinating array of covers (the Stooges, MF Doom, aforementioned stepdad Don Cherry), with the outstanding offering Cherry’s reading of Suicide’s “Dream Baby Dream,” backed up by minimalist upright bass and drums, with an increasingly skronky sax eventually taking over before Cherry reins things back in – a track that seems to go on forever, yet I’m never ready for it to end. --Shawn Campbell"

      "description": "Powerful but austere, Fiona Apple’s all-acoustic fourth album out Kanye’s Kanye in it’s deeply personal, painfully honest portrait of an artist biting themselves and the ones around them to feed their ravenous love of their craft. --James Vest"

      "artist": "The Men",
      "label": "Sacred Bones",
      "release": "Open Your Heart",
      "description": "A successful sophomore concept from this NY group - filled with aggressive rock and punk, to krautrock instrumentals to even a country ballad (though some find the last one a mis-step). This is definitely my record of 2012. --Caitlin Lavin"

      "artist": "Angel Olsen",
      "label": "Bathetic Records",
      "release": "Half Way Home",
      "description": "Chicago's Angel Olsen's haunting voice seems to crackle with hints of unused power reserves hiding just beneath the surface. She's already slaying me and she's got so much left in the tank! Beautiful, pensive, dark blue Americana. --Dave Staples"

      "release": "Wonderlust",
      "description": "These guys took my top spot because local trumps everything. This is their second album and they create an incredibly lush sound. I would like to see them get some more notoriety within the local scene. There is a lot of talent here. --Andy Weber"

      "artist": "California Wives",
      "label": "Vagrant",
      "release": "Art History",
      "description": "Here's the deal: The debut album from this Chicago band isn't going to solve the crisis in the middle east. It won't move mountains. And it definitely won't be the number one listened to album on Spotify. But I'm not giving it this top ten classification for any of these reasons. What this album is, is good. No, it's great. Any album that just makes you want to sing your heart out and dance like you are in high school, to me, is worth it's weight in gold. Indie pop rock gold. --Michelle Nadeau"

      "artist": "Outer Minds",
      "label": "Southpaw",
      "release": "S/T",
      "description": "I was thrilled to discover local act Outer Minds early in 2012, and they rewarded me with some fantastic live shows, as well as two full-length albums. I liked both a lot, but my favorite was their first, a poppier affair full of Nuggets-style hooks and Mamas and Papas harmonies. --Shawn Campbell"

      "release": "Visions",
      "description": "Like nothing else, Claire's majestic soundscapes charm the pants off me like a Boucher painting. It may not be rococo, but has all the intimacy of a sexy seance on really good natural meds. The more I listen, the more hypnotic it becomes. Sometimes it unintentionally comes on like bubblegum goth. This must be some kind of genius. Bewitchingly intimate, beautiful at times, Visions works on all sorts of levels and seasons. --Jonny Madness"

      "label": "Hardly Art",
      "release": "A Different Arrangement",
      "description": "Ice-cold synth pop never sounded so warm. This electro-goth album sounds like it came directly from the early 80's. The vocals sound like they were recorded through an air duct from across the building with the fan on. I hear the Cure here, I hear a melodic & more hopeful incarnation of Joy Division. So much synth! So much upbeat darkness! --Dave Staples"

      "release": "Mazes Blazes",
      "description": "Pair the unique brand of Chicago chamber-twee cuteness exemplified by The 1900s, Canasta, and Scotland Yard Gospel Choir with the breakneck lunacy of Guided By Voices or The Olivia Tremor Control's best work, and you get an idea of what was the Windy City's best record of 2012. Sharing members with The 1900s, this wacky selection of adorable tunes would fit awkwardly in a Glasgow coffeeshop, or perfectly in a Dunedin pub. At its heart Blazes is a sweet selection of indie-pop glory, with enough changes in attitude and tempo to keep the listener off-balance. --Austin Bainard Harvey"
